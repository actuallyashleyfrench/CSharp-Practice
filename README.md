# CSharpPractice Projects

This repository contains C# console applications and mini-projects I completed as a refresher and refinement of my programming skills in preparation for a development role. 
The projects focus on core C# fundamentals and object-oriented programming concepts.


## Whatâ€™s Included:
- Cookbook Generator: A console application allowing users to create, edit, search, and save recipes using classes, lists, and file serialization.

- Gradebook Generator: A console app that collects student names and grades, then calculates and displays the highest and lowest scores, class average, 
grade distribution counts, and optionally supports saving results or filtering students by grade.

- Other Mini Challenges: Exercises involving loops, conditionals, methods, arrays, lists, exception handling, and LINQ queries.



## Skills Demonstrated:
- Writing clean, maintainable C# code with comments 
- XML documentation (applied in Cookbook Generator)
- Creating and using classes, properties, and methods
- Managing collections with List<T> and LINQ queries
- File handling with JSON serialization/deserialization
- User input validation and error handling



## How to Run:
Each project is a separate console app. You can open the solution in Visual Studio and run the project of your choice.
